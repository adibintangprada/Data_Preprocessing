# Data Preprocessing
Data preprocessing is a substantial step before proceeds to modelling using Machine Learning or Deep Learning. If the model that has been created produces less effective results, Data Scientist will return to preprocessing data. Because preprocessing data greatly affects the results of the effectiveness of the model later. Most of the data scientists' time is spent on data preprocessing. These are data preprocessing steps in this repository:
* Data Understanding
* Data Cleaning and Preprocessing (Check Duplicate Data, Check Data Types, Check Missing Values, Impute Missing Values)
* Handling Outlier
* Feature Engineering (Encoding Variables)
* Data Partition
* Synthetic Minority Over-Sampling Technique (SMOTE)

## Overview
For this project i use dataset called Loan. Data preprocessing is a data mining technique that involves transforming raw data into an understandable format. Real-world data is often incomplete, inconsistent, and/or lacking in certain behaviors or trends, and is likely to contain many errors. Data preprocessing is a proven method of resolving such issues.
